Hi, this is a website I've made for my coding class assessment AS91903, Use complex techniques to develop a digital media outcome. 
I've made a website on senior attendance tracking to help the seniors with class work and other school-related matters.
My goal for this assessment was to make a website with complex techniques to make a digital outcome for the students, teachers and parents of Aotea College.
With the use of relevant implications, html, css and java script.
